## The Staff Engineer Archetypes

Based on Will Larson's *Staff Engineer*.

1.  **The Tech Lead**: Guides the approach and execution of a specific team. "The Captain".
2.  **The Architect**: Responsible for technical direction across a specific area (e.g., API Standards). "The Planner".
3.  **The Solver**: Digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems. "The Fixer".
4.  **The Right Hand**: Extends the executive's attention. "The Proxy".

### The Shift
-   **Junior/Senior**: "How do I solve this problem?" (Code).
-   **Staff+**: "What problem should we solve?" (Context).

## Writing Design Docs (RFCs)

The most important tool for a Staff Engineer is the **Written Document**.

### RFC Structure (Request For Comment)
1.  **Problem / Background**: Why are we doing this?
2.  **Goals / Non-Goals**: What is success? What is out of scope?
3.  **Proposed Solution**: High-level design.
4.  **Alternatives Considered**: Why *not* Option B? (Critical section).
5.  **Risks**: What could go wrong?
6.  **Timeline**: When?

### The Review Process
-   Send draft to key stakeholders early.
-   Don't surprise people in the final meeting.
-   "Nod your head" meetings: The decision should inevitably be made *before* the meeting starts via comments.

## Influence Without Authority

You cannot order people to do things (usually). You must convince them.

### Techniques
1.  **Social Capital**: Build trust by helping others first.
2.  **Inception**: Plant the idea so they think it's theirs.
3.  **Consistency**: Be the person who always brings data, not opinions.
4.  **Disagree and Commit**: Argue passionately, but once a decision is made, support it fully.

## Sponsorship and Mentorship

**Mentorship**: Giving advice. (Private).
**Sponsorship**: Putting your reputation on the line to lift someone up. (Public).

**How to Sponsor**:
-   "Jane would be great for this high-visibility project."
-   "I agree with John's point." (Amplification in meetings).
-   Redirecting praise: "I didn't do this, Team X did."

## Managing Up

Your manager is your API to the organization.

-   **No Surprises**: Bad news must be delivered immediately, not waited on.
-   **Bring Solutions**: "We have a problem X. I propose Y or Z. I recommend Y."
-   **Understand Business Context**: Does the VP care about "Code Quality" or "Time to Market"? Frame your arguments in *their* currency.
